# Cross-Platform-Mobile-Applicatio-Development-Using-Kivy-and-Python
Kivy is an open source Python framework for creating cross-platform multi-touch mobile applications with Natural User Interface.
## Why Kivy?
Kivy is an open source Python framework for creating cross-platform multi-touch mobile applications with Natural User Interface. Its speed is comparable to other native mobile alternatives like Java for Android and Objective C for iOS. Kivy is the only solution for coding in Python on mobile devices. It is also capable of running on multiple platforms like HTML5 because it does not depend on heavy browser support, and is implemented in C using Cython due to which it runs directly on the GPU. The main aim that was kept in mind while developing Kivy was to run the same code on multiple platforms.
